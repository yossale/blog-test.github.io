Iâ€™m a really passionate techie (everything from devops & backend to Machine Learning to iOS & Android apps), with a keen interest in Social sciences (I even went and got myself a Masterâ€™s degree inÂ [STS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Science_and_technology_studies)) and a dedicated Vipassana practitioner (since I was 23 y.o). 

Iâ€™ve worked in very large firms (hey there,Â [Intel](https://medium.com/@intel))Â , small startups that became giants (hello to you too,Â [Outbrain](https://medium.com/@Outbrain)), medium startups that were bought by giants (Clearforest, nowÂ [ThomsonReuters Foundation](https://medium.com/@TRFoundation)), joined crazy ventures (donâ€™t exist anymore ðŸ˜ž), joined a bank ([LeumiTech](https://medium.com/@LeumiTech)), realized itâ€™s not for me, kept playing with fin-tech atÂ [Capitolis](https://www.capitolis.com), and now at [Altostra](https://www.altostra.com/), where I help developers **use** Serverless instead of working in it .

I did Machine Learning, NLP, a little bit of Vision, some Speech-to-Text, billing, written backend in Java, Scala, RoR and Nodejs, built AWS infrastructure and developed Ionic apps for Android and iOS. So Iâ€™m kind of an all-around guy. I seek to be constantly engaged in curios things I havenâ€™t done yetâ€Šâ€”â€ŠI love tera-incognita, and rather walk the bleeding cutting edge.
