Unfortunately , we reached the conclusion that HBase is still not stable enough for us to use in production environment. I think it’s a great project , and I’m certain that it will become a very important open-source tool in the not-so-far future – but currently , it just not good enough for what we need. I’ll keep posting about out new solution (once we find it) , and where it takes us.
