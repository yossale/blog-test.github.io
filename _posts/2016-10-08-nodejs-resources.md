title: Two JS lectures that will change the way you thing of JS

---

I'm a backend guy, with backend habits and natural aversion from JavaScript. I used to think of it as the 
frankenstein of language - something hastly created, adopted for usages it wasn't designed for, and grow up like a wild bush.
These two brilliant lectures, both from JSConf 2014, made me think of it in a whole new perspective.

The first is  ["Javascript - the good parts"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bo36MrBfTk4) by Douglas Crockford, and the second is
[What the heck is the event loop anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ) by Philip Roberts - a wonderfull explanation of JS - and specially the event loop, actually work. Really splendid!
