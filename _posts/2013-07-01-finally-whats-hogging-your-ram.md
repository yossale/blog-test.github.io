Some of you may have noticed that the Windows Task Manager doesn't show you the real memory consumption of the applications you're running. It's quite obvious, specially when the actual memory consumption, and the sum of the memory consumption presented by the task manager doesn't add up!

But fear not! Microsoft has a tool called [RAMMap][1] that will tell you, in excruciating details, exactly which process and file use each memory page. No longer will you try voodooing your application to find out what is draining your RAM!

You can get it right [here][2]
