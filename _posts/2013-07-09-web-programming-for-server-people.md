I'm mainly a back-end engineer - through my not-so-long career, I've dealt with sql, no-sql, offline processes, etl mechanisms, billing services, web-crawlers, recommendation system, offline learning algorithms, and so forth, and so forth. The only web-related thing I did was to write struts hooks for specific server functions. So basically, I know nothing about http-requests, css, javascripts and other web-thingies - which makes me feel a bit handicapped.

So I was very happy to find the [Ruby On Rails tutorial byÂ Michael Hartl][1]. It's not a"Learn ruby and do some web things" - it's more like"Basics of web programming - using Ruby on Rails as an example". Going through the tutorial, you'll learn a lot about web-programming thinking, conventions, and all those pesky thing about web-programming you didn't know you didn't know.

It's very well written, takes you fast to where you want to go, and if you have enough programming background, you'll skim right through it.

If you're a back-end programmer and you want to know what this front-end thing is all about - this is definitely the tutorial for you. And it's FREE!
