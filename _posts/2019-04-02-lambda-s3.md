title: "Lambda: Move S3 file based on content"
---

We have a process that saves a file to an S3 bucket. We needed a lambda to read the file, parse part of the content, and move the file to the appropriate folder in the bucket -  So we set up a lambda to run whenever a file is created in the base folder of the bucket, read the file, and move it to the appropriate place.
