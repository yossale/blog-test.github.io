XML is not native to Java. Many will disagree, but this is just the simple truth. It's tedious, messy and generally ugly - specially compares to Groovy or Scala.

However, if you DO need to use XML in Java, do yourself a favour and use [java-xmlbuilder][1].  I've tried it on easy-weight tasks, and it's by far the simplest most straight-forward XML tool for Java I've used so far.

Enjoy!
