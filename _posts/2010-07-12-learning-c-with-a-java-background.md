I’m a Java programmer , and  I’m starting to work on a production project written in C# , so this is a great time to start learning this language . I’ve never used any of MS languages , so this is basically my first time in a .Net world .

So far I’ve found these resources , which are really great :

  1. [Code snippets in Java Vs C#][1] – This is just **great!** It takes snippets from java and shows how they would have been written in C# . It’s really very very useful .
  2. <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/CsharpVsJava.html" target="_blank">C# vs java</a> - Very useful comparison between C# and Java - Every topic is dicussed in \*short\* , and have code snippets added.** Strongly recommended!**
  3. [The C# Programming Language for Java Developers][2] – Microsoft has a very detailed (and very well formed , actually) for people switching from Java to C# .
  4. [Switching from Java to C#][3] – A question posted on [Stack Overflow][4] – Many many good comments and resources.

I’ll keep this updated when I stumble upon more resources , but this is it for now. Most of the following posts will probably be about the Java –> C# transition.
